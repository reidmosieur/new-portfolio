    "explanation": "## Explanation\n\nWho would have thought that something as simple as a game where you try to guess a word could be so complicated? That's what I thought, at least, when I was done building this little clone of Wordle. Why did I choose to build this?\n\nSimple, a [Wordle clone](https://github.com/reidmosieur/Wordle-Clone) was one of the first ever actual projects I did on my own. I built that using just bog standard HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The word was the same every time and every input was hard coded. What a surprise for a first project, right?\n\nNow that I know how to use React, I was able to build something totally different despite being based on the same exact game. A random word is chosen using the library random-words, the length of the word can be changed by the user, and you even get a nice [little API interaction](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to get the definition of the word.\n\nThe code needs some refactoring for sure. I don't like how much I've decoupled the state from the context instead of centralizing it all. That's honestly just because I didn't realize the complexity of the project until later in the process, and hey, [if it works, don't touch it right (sarcasm by the way)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/pj2z3i/rule1_dont_touch_it_if_its_working/)",
