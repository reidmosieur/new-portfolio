## A Simple App

This really was a test in building a full stack app and integrating payments. I really liked the idea and I was able to spin this up quickly.

## How I Built It

A true full stack app built using Next.js, MongoDB, and Stripe for payments.

### Front End

As is my standard, I built this using Next.js on the front end. For styling, I used Tailwind for the first time. Tailwind was an excellent choice, and it has become a new standard for me. The utility and manageability of Tailwind is excellent, and anything I can use to speed up my time to build and learn and iterate is vital for me.

### Back End

Again, my standard is Next.js for the back end as well. Combining and maintaining the front and back end at the same time allows me to quickly build without sacrificing best practices.

On the data side, I used MongoDB. In this case, it really wasn't the ideal database implementation, a relational database like PostgreSQL would have made more sense, but I wanted to learn how to use a document store instead. I enjoyed learning it quite a bit and I am confident in my abilities with it in the future.
